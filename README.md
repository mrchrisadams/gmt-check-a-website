# GMT "Just a Website" Test

This repo is set up as an experiment in using the Green Metrics Tool, and their hosted measurement cluster to run measurements for interactions on a single website.

This was created as a follow up to feedback in the Djangocon Europe workshop linked below, and represents an example of a simplified usage_scenario.yml, to help people get to a measurement from a hosted GMT cluster as fast as possible.
